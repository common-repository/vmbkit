Sick and tired of maintaining several blog installations? Want one WordPress installation to rule them all? Try this plugin.

This plugin assists with the creation of multi-blogs on top of Virtual Multiblog, so that all blogs are powered by a single WordPress code base. It also assists with proper Virtual Multiblog setup.

Check out the [plug-in homepage](http://hackadelic.com/solutions/wordpress/vmbkit "Hackadelic Multiblog Kit") for in-depth information about the plug-in.

### Change Log

#### 0.1 - Initial public beta release.
>**Attention**:
>This version has only been tested with a standard WordPress installation, *and it works well under such conditions*. However, it could have issues when a *wp-config.php* has been manually tweaked significantly, though this is quite unlikely.
>
> It also relies heavily on a specific work flow with Virtual Multiblog, so *it may not work propertly with manual VMB setups* that differ from the assumed work flow.
>
>Having said that, it is fairly safe to use the plugin. It creates a backup of *wp-config.php* before touching it, and supports a "dry mode" where you can see what would be written to what filte before actually writing anything.
>
> [Let me know if you encounter any issues](http://hackadelic.com/solutions/wordpress/vmbkit#comment).
>
> And remember: **Backup early! Backup often!**
